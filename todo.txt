- problems with obstacles and optimum goal decision (take acount angle from current vel_actual.
- Add boundaries
- Obstacles avoidance fix --> not always avoiding
- Initialization positions of drones
- Code refactoring

- Fix updating matplotlib efficiency (port to PyGame, or other graphics)
- Export to image or to animation

IMPORTANT:
 - Readjustment of fitness function 
	· Problems with time.monotonic()
	· Problems with NEG_INF
	· Problems with oscillation angle situation and rounding() fitness value 

	SOLUTIONS: 
	  - Make a simpler fitness function with INTEGER values
